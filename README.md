### **Steps** -
1. Generating Data with Python
   - Using Python, I created a dataset that mimics the operations of Raksha Pipes. This included generating fake data for products, customers, sales, and other relevant information.

2. Saving Data in CSV Format
   - I saved the generated dataset as CSV files in a folder on my Google Drive for easy access and management.

3. Setting Up MySQL Database and Designing Schema
   - I created a MySQL database named "raksha_pipes" and designed its structure to match the dataset. This involved writing SQL queries to create tables with the right columns and relationships.

4. Importing Data into MySQL
   - I imported the CSV files into the MySQL database to populate the tables with data.
5. Connecting MySQL to Power BI
   - I connected the MySQL database to Power BI to analyze the data and create visualizations.

6. Creating Dashboard in Power BI
   - Using Power BI's tools, I designed an interactive dashboard to showcase key insights from the Raksha Pipes dataset.

7. Presenting Findings in a Video
   - I documented the entire process in a presentation video, explaining each step and highlighting important insights from the dashboard.
